# VueUdemy


1227/5000
This project comprises the basic Udemy Vue.Js Introduction course. The course consists of basically 4.5 hours ranging from getting started, using basic Vue, the main directives (v-model, v-bind, v-on, v-if, v-for, v-button), the main components. of a Vue object like data, methods, filters, computed, watch etc.

A brief introduction on the construction of some components was also presented and finally a more complex project called netflix_vue was built.

In this project some broader concepts are presented, based on the construction of a project using Vue-Cli. More information on the page. https://cli.vuejs.org/.

The following applications were used in a complementary way:

* Json-server, to simulate a Rest fake API quickly. https://github.com/typicode/json-server
* Vue-resorce: A Vue.js plugin provides services for making web requests and handling responses using an XMLHttpRequest or JSONP. https://github.com/pagekit/vue-resource
* Vue Router: The Vue Router is the official router of Vue.js. It integrates deeply into the core of Vue.js. to make it easy to build single-page apps with Vue.js. https://router.vuejs.org/
